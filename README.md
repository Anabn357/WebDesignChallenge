### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `Web-Design-Challenge`. **Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for the web challenge. Use a folder name to correspond to the challenge: **WebVisualizations**.

4. Add your **html** files to this folder as well as your **assets**, **Resources** and **visualizations** folders.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub or GitLab.

6. Deploy to GitHub pages.
